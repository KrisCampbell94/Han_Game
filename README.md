# Han_Game
The game involves the philosophical concept of the act of revenge. The famous quote, “An Eye for an Eye” is symbolically placed in this game. Han’s journey starts after the massacre of his clan at the hands of the Solos. He vowed to get stronger, and to wipe out the entire Solos. That’s what 韩 is about. However, by seeking revenge and in accordance to the player’s skill, he shall succeed. Though this will not bring back his clan, and he’s left feeling empty yet filled with power gained from the adventure. Accomplishing the goal, but getting no satisfaction at the end, Han continues to persevere against and eventually overmaster his foes, wielding his trusty kunai knives and his gravity ninjutsu.
